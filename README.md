Spacebrew-Unity3d-Arduino-Processing
====================================

An example of how to get Spacebrew to work with Unity3d, Arduino &amp; Processing to show how to have a game element affect a physical item and vice versa. 

I have written an in-depth tutorial here: 
+ Starting a local Spacebrew server http://thebitchwhocodes.com/2014/07/24/internet-of-th…acebrew-part-1
+ Hooking Up Unity with Spacebrew http://thebitchwhocodes.com/2014/07/24/internet-of-th…acebrew-part-2
+ Hooping up Processing and Arduino to Spacebrew http://thebitchwhocodes.com/2014/07/24/internet-of-th…acebrew-part-3
I have posted a powerpoint with the steps ( a bit shorter ) - https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=7F39F5A167CA774F%2112047

This repository has three folders:
+ Processing - code for the processing portion with Arduino
+ Arduino - images for circuit diagrams
+ Unity3d - basic Unity project that has the Spacebrew SDK


Arduino Requirements:
+ Arduino Board ( Uno etc ) 
+ Jumper wires
+ 10k resistor
+ 220k resistor
+ push button
+ led

Downloads Needed
+ Processing IDE https://processing.org/download/
+ Arduino IDE http://arduino.cc/en/main/software
+ Spacebrew SDK for Processing  https://github.com/Spacebrew/spacebrewP5
+ Arduino for Processing  http://playground.arduino.cc/interfacing/processing
