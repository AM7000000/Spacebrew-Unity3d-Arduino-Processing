Spacebrew-Unity3d-Arduino-Processing
====================================

An example of how to get Spacebrew to work with Unity3d, Arduino &amp; Processing to show how to have a game element affect a physical item and vice versa. 

I have written an in-depth tutorial here: http://thebitchwhocodes.com/2014/07/24/internet-of-thâ€¦acebrew-part-1

This repository has three folders:
Processing - code for the processing portion with Arduino
Arduino - images for circuit diagrams
Unity3d - basic Unity project that has the Spacebrew SDK
